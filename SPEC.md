## Core Game Loop
**Hunt for missing objects and return them to their proper places.**
1. Find an object
2. Pick it up
3. Find its "home"
4. Return it
5. Solved counter goes up
6. Not all solved? **REPEAT 1-5**
7. All solved? **WIN**

## Mechanics
1. Pick-Up / Return an object
   - Can only pick up one at a time
   - Can drop an object anywhere
   - Objects must be placed in the correct spot to be "solved"
   - Example: pick up the pillows from the kitchen and return them to the bed to then make the bed
2. Linked Objects
   - Some objects' placement unlocks other objects (e.g., place the pillows on the bed before you can make the bed, which reveals the broom you need to sweep the floor)
3. (STRETCH GOAL) Rotate Objects
   - Instead of perfect alignment, require rotating the object in 90-degree increments to match the target shape
